_You are walking in a desert with 5 animals, but you have to leave one of the animals behind._

_Choose which animal to abandon, this may reveal how you handle specific aspects of your life._



1. Match-case syntax equivalent to if/ elif/ else:
```
match variable:
    case 1:
        print("1")
    case 2:
        print("2")
```
2. Use while loop on a menu:
```
while True:
    print_menu()
    variable = ""
    try:
        print("")
    except:
        print("")
```
3. Use 'exit' to end the loop:
```
exit()
```
4. Define function to use in the loop:
```
def functionName1()
    print("")
...
...
...
match variable:
    case 1:
        functionName1()
```
